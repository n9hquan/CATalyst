# CATalyst - CS50P Final Project

Welcome to CATalyst, a program for cat enthusiasts! <br />
This is a project I built for my final project in CS50P course from Harvard.

## Getting Started

### How To Install

Simply download the main file and run it in your IDE to run the program (assuming you already have Python installed).

### Packages Requirements

You need to install 2 packages: <br />
- cowsay
- requests
Run pip install cowsay requests in your terminal to install.

### How To Use

- Choose 1 to get a random cat fact.
- Choose 2 to get a random customized cat picture. You will be asked to prompt the phrase, font size and font color. It will then ask you to open a new tab in the browser to view the picture you just have customized yourself.
- Choose 3 to learn about a specific cat breed via description and its life span. First, you will be given a full list of cat breeds and asked to enter 'yes' or 'no' to filter out a smaller group of cat breeds with your chosen first capital letter. If you press 'no', then you will be asked to input the name of a cat breed. If you press 'yes', you will be given a sorted list and will then asked to input the name of a cat breed. The information of the cat breed will then showed.
